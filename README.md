# PyProjects
The code behind short projects/files I have done with Python, C# and other languages.

Learnt Python through a [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

Learnt the other languages through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)

Being able to learn and use an IDE possesses a certain level of difficulty when you don't have anyone to teach you, hence why the code for C# and Java is not tested.
